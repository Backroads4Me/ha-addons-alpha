# Python dependencies for BTBerryWifi Bluetooth WiFi Setup
# 
# Note: Core dependencies (dbus-python, PyGObject, cryptography) are installed
# via Alpine packages in the Dockerfile to avoid version conflicts:
#   - py3-dbus
#   - py3-gobject3  
#   - py3-cryptography
#
# Add any additional pure-Python dependencies here if needed
